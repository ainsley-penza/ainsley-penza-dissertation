## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project tackles the challenge of **automating data extraction from invoices**. Manual entry is a drag â€“ it's slow, error-prone, and frankly, not the best use of anyone's time. This dissertation, for the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST), explores a Machine Learning pipeline to digitize this process efficiently. I'm using the power of **YOLOv12 for object detection** and **Tesseract OCR for text recognition** to transform invoice images into clean, structured JSON data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Aims & Objectives

The core mission is to design, build, and test a robust ML system for extracting key information from invoices.

* **Dataset Curation:** Assemble and meticulously annotate a diverse set of invoice images.
* **Element Detection:** Train a **YOLOv12 model** to accurately pinpoint essential invoice fields (like invoice numbers, dates, totals, line items, etc.).
* **Text Extraction:** Employ **Tesseract OCR** to "read" the text within the detected regions.
* **Structured Output:** Convert the extracted data into a developer-friendly **JSON format**.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Rigorously assess the system's accuracy and efficiency.
